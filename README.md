## What good is data without a good plot to tell the story?  Apply Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset.


Pymaceuticals, Inc. is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

### Analysis

- The final distribution of tumor volume, the median, and the variation with the middle 50% of Capomulin and Ramicane treatments are lower than Infubinol and Ceftamin treatments. Therefore, Capomulin and Ramicane treatments tend to control the tumor volume better than Infubinol and Ceftamin treatments.

- We can see that in mouse l509 treated with Capomulin; the tumor volume tends to decrease as time in days goes by.

- There is a positive correlation of 0.84 between mouse weight and the average tumor volume for the entire Capomulin regimen. For this reason, as the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume increases.
